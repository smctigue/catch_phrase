# Project requirements
Create a basic CRUD app. 
- A user can see a JSON object which contains phrases and definitions when visiting the index ('/'). A user can also add and/or remove a phrase from the database/page without having to refresh (AJAX).

- Updating a description sends a confirmation that the phrase has been updated

# How-to
- Download/install dependencies
